Antelope Tasks Installation:

Make sure Ant is installed correctly. Locate the directory where Ant is 
installed. Locate a directory named "lib" in that directory.

Unzip the distribution file. It will create a directory named 
AntelopeTasks_3.4.2.

Change to the AntelopeTasks_3.4.2 directory. In this directory will be a 
jar file named AntelopeTasks_3.4.2.jar.

Copy the jar file to Ant's "lib" directory.
