Antelope Installation:

Make sure Ant is installed correctly and that the Ant startup script is in your path.

Unzip the distribution file. It will create a directory named AntelopeApp_3.4.1.

Change to the AntelopeApp_3.4.1 directory. 

From a command prompt, run:

java -jar AntelopeApp_3.4.1.jar

If your platform supports it, you can also double click on the jar file from
a file browser.
