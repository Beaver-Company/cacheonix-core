<p>Provides interfaces and classes for the distributed lock framework.</p>

Cacheonix provides a distributed mutual exclusions API that allows clustered applications to maintain consistency by
serializing access to shared data. Multiple servers that modify shared resources concurrently may cause interference and
data inconsistency. Distributed locks by Cacheonix provide safety of data access, application liveness and simplicity of
programming.

Cacheonix write locks ensure safe access to the shared data. At most one thread on one server may enter the section of
code protected by a distributed write lock. Cacheonix increases concurrency by offering read locks. Applications that
are only reading the shared data may execute the section of the code protected by read locks simultaneously.

Cacheonix ensures liveness of clustered applications by building on top of its reliable symmetric clustering protocol.
Cacheonix seamlessly releases locks held by servers that fail or leave the cluster. Cacheonix prevents application
stalling by detecting deadlocks and breaking the deadlocks automatically.

Cacheonix makes programming with distributed locks as simple as in a single Java VM. Cacheonix supports nested locks.
Cacheonix upgrades read locks to write locks when necessary. The distributed locks API has the same interface as
java.concurrent.locks:

<pre>

   Cacheonix cacheonix = Cacheonix.getInstance();
	ReadWriteLock readWriteLock = cacheonix.getCluster().getReadWriteLock();
	Lock writeLock = readWriteLock.writeLock();
	writeLock.lock();
	try {
	   // Critical section protected by the lock
	   ...
	} finally {
	   writeLock.unlock();
	}
</pre>
