<body>
Provides interfaces and classes for distributed parallel data processing. Cacheonix significantly improves performance of
processing of the data stored in the cluster by executing processing requests in parallel, on all members of the
cluster. Cacheonix cluster protocol and data replication ensure that the data is processed consistently even while
servers fail or join the cluster. Cacheonix eliminates delays caused by network latency by providing data affinity, by
sending the processing requests exactly to the machines that contain the data that must be processed. Only the results
of the processing are sent back.
